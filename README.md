# Lean-Supply-Chain-Project

##Project Objective

The objective of this Lean process improvement project was to reduce Truck Turnaround Time (TTT) at a container terminal by identifying, quantifying, and eliminating non–value-added activities across gate, yard, and out-gate operations. The project focused on improving operational flow, throughput, and equipment effectiveness while minimizing delays caused by process inefficiencies and external dependencies.

##Problem Statement

-Truck Turnaround Time was significantly higher than the ideal benchmark due to:

-Slow transaction speed at E-Gate and Out-Gate

-Repetitive operational and compliance-related issues

-Process dependency on external actors (truckers, clearing agents, customs)

-Lack of early detection of issues that surfaced late in the process

-These inefficiencies resulted in congestion, lost capacity, increased waiting time, and reduced terminal productivity 


##Scope of the Project

The analysis focused on Import Base (IB) and Reefer Export (RE) truck groups, which together represented the highest share of delivery volume and variability in TTT. The end-to-end process was segmented into:

-Pre-Yard2Truck delays

-Yard2Truck → Weighment

-Weighment → Documentation (Form A)

-Documentation → Gate-Out

-Each segment was analyzed independently to isolate root causes and quantify delay impact.

##Key KPIs and Measures

-Truck Turnaround Time (TTT)

-Definition: Total time from Gate-In to Gate-Out

-Purpose: Primary performance metric to assess process efficiency

-Baseline: ~126 minutes (actual)

-Target: ~85 minutes (lean benchmark)

-Insight: Out-Gate waiting time contributed disproportionately to total TTT

##E-Gate / Out-Gate Transaction Time

-Definition: Time required to complete gate transactions (with and without weighment)

-Measure: Average transaction duration per truck

-Lean Goal: Reduce processing time and increase trucks/hour per booth

-Impact: Improved booth throughput and reduced queue buildup

##Waiting Time at Out-Gate Queue

-Definition: Idle time spent by trucks waiting for Out-Gate processing

-Baseline: ~30 minutes average

-Target: ~10 minutes acceptable waiting

-Finding: Waiting time was double the ideal proportion of TTT

-Segment-Level Process Duration

##Measures:

-Yard2Truck → Weighment

-Weighment → Form A Print

-Form A Print → Gate-Out

-Metrics Used: Median, mean, quartiles

-Purpose: Identify bottlenecks and variability within each stage

##Issue Frequency (Pareto Analysis)

-Definition: Count of repetitive issues delaying delivery

-Examples: Seal disparity, system errors, documentation issues

-Lean Tool: Pareto principle (80/20)

-Outcome: Identified high-frequency, high-severity issues for prioritization

##Issue Severity (Delay Impact)

-Definition: Additional delay (in minutes) caused by each issue type

-Insight: Some low-frequency issues caused extreme delays

-Tool Used: Box plots and severity segmentation

##Throughput (Trucks per Hour per Booth)

-Definition: Number of trucks processed per hour at gate booths

-Purpose: Measure capacity utilization

-Result: Reduced transaction time directly increased throughput

##Process Compliance & Behavioral Leakage

-Measure: Unrecorded idle time and misuse of parking-charge loopholes

-Insight: Behavioral incentives significantly impacted KPIs

-Outcome: Policy redesign recommendations to prevent system gaming

##Lean & Analytics Techniques Used

-Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

-Time & motion studies

-Pareto analysis

-Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams

-Segmentation by frequency × severity

-Median vs mean analysis to handle outliers

-Root cause analysis across Man, Machine, Method, Material, Measurement

##Business Impact

-Reduced Truck Turnaround Time

-Increased gate throughput and equipment utilization

-Lower congestion and operational delays

-Improved predictability and planning

-Strong foundation for continuous improvement and KPI governance
